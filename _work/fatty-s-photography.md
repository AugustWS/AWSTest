We love working with photographers....specially wedding photographers. But of course , we need to try really hard to concentrate on the process of web design and not be distracted by their amazing pictures.  Our photographer was very particular about segregating his work into different categories. For each category, the client wanted a different layout to bring out the beauty of his pictures.  The main challenge we had as web developers were to determine which web layout looked good with which category and how do we make the layouts cohesive
