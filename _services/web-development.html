why:
- Your website acts as your online representation. It is responsible for making a
  visual impression of who you are. A creative, interactive and useful web design
  is what people are going to come back to. A well designed website has the potential
  to bring in more clients as it brings in a good user experience. The right colour
  palate, the right font, the right layout are all crucial. As miniscule as it may
  seem, your website shows your personality.
