### Search Engine Optimization (also known as SEO) is important for your website and your marketing efforts. 

Proper search engine optimization requires a full time effort as Google's algorithm and user's keyword searches are constantly changing. What was effective for you last month, may no longer be working for you this month. Simply having your web developer include metadata on your site will no longer do the trick. Here is what's needed for proper search engine optimization:  

* Regularly updated keyword research
  * Review keyword data on a quarterly basis to see how many average monthly searches keywords/keyphrases are getting
  * Determine which keywords are a good fit for your marketing goals so you can begin to create content in an effort to rank for those keywords
* Website Performance Review- your website performance is a huge factor in your search engine ranking so you need to consistently review it's performance by monitoring:
  * Browser Caching
  * Page Redirects
  * File Compression
  * Page Load Time (under 4 seconds recommended)
  * _*Your mobile site performance is an entirely different measurement that affects your SEO as well*_
* Creating the Proper MetaData for your Site (this is the information that is displayed in Google Search results)
  * Page Titles: Should be no longer than 70 characters / avoid repeating keywords
  * Meta Descriptions: Should be around 150 characters and must be relevant to your page content
  * Page Headings: These should be keyword optimized while still being relevant to the content of the page
  * Sitemap: Submitting a sitemap to Google helps with your SEO and can also act as a guide for users navigating your website
* Blogging-posting blogs is a great way to boost your SEO results. Fresh content is a great way to attract visitors to your site. KP Kreative can ghost blog on your behalf or edit your blogs to optimize them for your SEO efforts
* Monthly Analytics Reports
  * Review website analytics and social insights to determine how your SEO efforts are working
  * Adjust your efforts as needed
